    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <ul>
        <p>Led Zeppelin were an English rock band that formed in London during the year 1968. Guitarist Jimmy Page composed most of the bands music during that time.
            Considered to be one of the pioneers of the Heavy Metal Genre due to their HEAVILY distorted guitar riffs written by Jimmy Page, OVER THE TOP vocals belted by Robert Plant, the FILTHY bass lines
            thumped by John Paul Jones, and the absolutely THUNDEROUS percusive beats played by John Bonham.  with over 200 million albums sold, these four power musicians have achieved many accolades and paved the way for musicians all over the world.
            They disbanded in 1980 with the unexpected death of drummer John Bonham due to alcohol asphyxiation.  They have since reunited a handful of times to perform at tribute and anniversary concerts.
