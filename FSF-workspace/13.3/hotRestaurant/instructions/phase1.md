**Instructions:**
​
  * Phase I: For this first phase, aim to write out the pieces that will need to be programmed to create the functionality of your application. Try to break it into 6-7 pieces.
​
* **Instructors/TAs:** Once time is up have students share their breakdowns. As a suggestion, here is a list that you can slack them. 
​
  * Create the front-end (visuals) for home page, reservation form, and reservation views.
​
  * Create a basic server using Express.JS
​
  * Create a few array variables that will hold the data
​
  * Create a set of routes for getting and posting table data
​
  * Create a set of routes for displaying the HTML pages
​
  * Use jQuery to run AJAX calls to GET and POST data from users to the Express server
